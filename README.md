# Park Reservation Database
![](parksDatabasegif.gif)

##### The Park Reservation Database allows a user to schedule reservations using the Command Line Interface.

<p>Users are able to choose from a list of parks in a database to gather information and choose from a list of campgrounds within each park. The list of campgrounds displays which month each individual campground is open, close, and a daily fee. Once a campground is chosen, the user is prompted for a range of dates and a name to create a reservation. After the range of dates is provided, the user must select from any available sites (if a site is unavailable, it will not be displayed). Each site has information such as accessibility, max occupancy, and total cost is displayed to the user. Once the user chooses a site, their reservation is saved to a database, and they are presented with a confirmation number. </p>
